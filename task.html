        <h2><i>The United States (US) has announced the imposition of additional tariff rates on goods from India under Executive Order (EO) 14329, signed on August 6, 2025</i></h2>
        <p> A <i>tariff</i> is a kind of tax or duty placed on goods when they are imported into another country. The purpose is usually to protect local industries by making foreign goods more expensive, or to pressure a trading partner in negotiation. When the us imposes a 50% tarif, it means that Indian products entering America will cost 50% more in import taxes, raising their price in the American market.</p>
        <h2><b>Why did the US imposes tariff on India ?</b></h2>
        <p>The US has long argued that India restricts American products, especially agricultural and manufacturing goods, by maintaing high import duties. In relation or to create pressure, America raised tariffs on several Indian exports. This move is part of wider trade disputes where both sides want better access to each other's markets</p>
        

         <h3><b>Impact on Indian exports</b></h3> 
         <p>High tariffs make Indian goods less competitive in the US market. For example, is an Indian product costs $100, with a 50% tariff it becomes $150for American buyers. This discourages imports, hurting Indian industries like textiles, leather, or agricultural products that depend heavily on the American market. Small buisness and farmers in India can suffer because their products become too expensive abroad.</p>
         <p><b>How Trump's tariffs affect your money</b>Tariffs may seems like a topic that only matters to economic policy wonks.But these import taxes affect you more than you think, even if you're not directly cutting the check. Since taking office in his second term, President Trump has imposed steep new tariffs on nearly all products imported steep new tariffs on nearly all products imported into into the US., ending decades of free trade policy and setting markets on a rocky course throughout 2025.Prior to the new tariff order, Indian exports to the US were generally subject to import duties between 0.5 and 10 percent. Under the revised framework, an additional 25 percentage points are now levied on top of these existing base duties. </p>
         
        <h3><b>Background: India’s inclusion in the Russia sanctions framework</b></h3>
        <p>The additional US tariffs on Indian imports originate from the sanctions framework established under then US President Joe Biden. EO 14024 (April 2021) declared a US national emergency in response to Russia’s foreign activities, while EO 14066 (March 2022) prohibited the import of Russian-origin oil and petroleum products.</p>

        <p>On August 6, 2025, President Donald J. Trump expanded this framework through EO 14329, citing India’s continued energy ties with Russia. As a result, US–India trade, previously characterized by relatively low tariff levels, now faces some of the steepest duties applied by Washington. Effective rates on many Indian exports have risen from single digits to nearly 50 percent, altering pricing structures and competitiveness in the US market.</p>
